# SimpleHTTPServer

A simple C# HTTP server: just launch the program
and open your favorite browser, then paste in the
URL box your computer's IP (IPv4) address, followed
by ':57348' (without apices). There you go! If you
want to change the displayed webpage just edit the
.html file in the "pages" folder inside the project's
directory.
